        <p>Hello, this is Lebron James. As you all know, I am argueably the best Basketball player in the world. I have won over 3 NBA championships, held the title of MVP in both finals and regular season over 8 times. I have also made over 14 all-star appeareances in my career in the NBA. Over my career, i have been the the Miami Heat and my current team the Cleveland Cavaliers. I have won numerous championships in both teams, but we have reached a stump in my career as a cavalier when facing the Golden State Warriors. </p>

        <p>During this year's final, my team, the Cleveland Cavaliers got swept. To be honest, i wasnt even surprised. This was the worst team that i have ever been on. J.R. Smith was on the henny during game three, while have my team was on the bench. Although Kevin Love did pretty good, that was all brought down by Tristan Thompson, who scored close to no points and got literally no rebounds. I have no idea why they were not on the bench. My General Manager better start trading them and finding me a new coach. Tyron Lue <strong><em>can't</em></strong> coach!!! I'm the one that does everything. </p>

        <p> There are 30 teams in the NBA. I have so many options on where to go next. I can hop over to the Golden State Warriors and be a snake like Kevin Durant, but where the fun in that. i might go back to Miami Heat and help dwayne Wade or i can go start another dynasty with the rooks back at the lakers. The knicks my be another good choice. their team is about as trash as ours and its about time they win another championship. My boy Kyrie Irving probally won't let me into the Boston Celtics. Honestly, should I stay or should I go? </p>
